pdb - MySQL and Postgres sharding proxy

**** IMPORTANT ****
This work is not complete or maintained! The most similar ative
project that I'm aware of is spock proxy, which is over here:
http://spockproxy.sourceforge.net/

Description
===========

pdb intends to be a proxy which hides the details of a "sharded" database from
application/SQL developers.

That is, application developers continue to write their code as if there were just
a single monolitic database. pdb translates and proxies the application's requests
to the appropriate shard(s), in parallel if possible, and marshalls the responses
back to the application.

Current state:
 . mysql protocol reverse-engineered
 . connection and non-query command proxying to mysql
 . basic hash-based sharding logic
 . 'update' queries shard correctly
